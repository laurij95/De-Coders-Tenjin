# Tenjin by Decoders
### This is a Github respository for the project course INFO 3604

## Overview
Tenjin is a mobile teacher's assistant application developed by Decoders as their final year project. 

The application automates the awarding and allocation of credit points to students based on their grades in the various in-course assessments, quizzes and assignments as well as facilitates the sharing of exclusive in-course material to students. There's a catch though, for a student to gain access to this in-course material, they must first 'buy' or 'purchase' the material using their credit points and this material can **only** be viewed in the application, that is, students are prohibited from sharing the materials.

The application facilitates user registration and authentication for both teachers and students.

The application allows teachers to upload a student gradesheet which is then used to calculate and allocate credit points to students. It also allows teachers to view, add, update and delete courses at their desire. Teachers can also upload, view, edit document details (such as name, course code, etc) as well as delete documents. The application also allows teachers to view their students. 

Tenjin allows students to view the tally of acquired credit points by course so that the student can keep track of their 'spending.' The app also allows students to view courses they are enrolled in as well as the respectful documents within those courses. The student is also allowed to 'pay' for or 'purchase' a document in order to view it.
